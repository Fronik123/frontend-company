# React + TypeScript + Vite

### Libraries
+ **react-virtuoso** + **react-router-dom** + **react-avatar** + **uuid**

### I chose **react-virtuoso** because it provides efficient and smooth virtualization for long lists. It allows rendering only the visible items, which significantly improves performance. The library is easy to integrate with React. Overall, it simplifies building fast and responsive list components.
